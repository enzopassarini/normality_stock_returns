# normality_stock_returns
In this project, daily stock returns data from four Brazilian blue chips (JBSS3, VALE3, PETR4, BBDC4) were obtained through Yahoo Finance. Density distributions were plotted; normality was tested using Jarque-Bera; and, as an extra, a risk x return matrix was displayed. The code can be easily manipulated and reproduced according to your will by changing the "assets" list values at the beginning of the code (with the exact ticks used in Yahoo Finance), as well as the desired start and end date.
