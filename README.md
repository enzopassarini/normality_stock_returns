# normality_stock_returns
In this project, daily stock returns data from four brazilian blue chips (JBSS3, VALE3, PETR4, BBDC4) is obtained through Yahoo Finance. Density distributions are plotted, normality is tested using Jarque-Bera, and, as an extra, a risk x return matrix is shown. The code can easily be reproducted by changing the assets list (with the exact names used in Yahoo Finance) in the beggining of the code, as well as the desired start and end date, so returns from lots of assets can be tested for normality.
