# normality_stock_returns
In this project, daily stock returns data from four brazilian blue chips (JBSS3, VALE3, PETR4, BBDC4) is obtained through Yahoo Finance. Density distributions are plotted, normality is tested using Jarque-Bera, and, as an extra, a risk x return matrix is shown. The code can be easily manipulated by changing the "assets" list (with the exact names used in Yahoo Finance) values in the beggining of the code, as well as the desired start and end date.
